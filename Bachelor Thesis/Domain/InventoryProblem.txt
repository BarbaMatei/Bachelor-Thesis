Stream 1: Sales Data

product_id (unique identifier for the product)
date_sold (the date the product was sold)
quantity_sold (the quantity of the product sold)
revenue (the revenue generated by the product sale)

Stream 2: Inventory Data

product_id (unique identifier for the product)
date_updated (the date the inventory was updated)
quantity_in_stock (the quantity of the product in stock)
In this example, we have two data streams: one for sales data and one for inventory data. Both streams contain information about products, including a unique identifier for each product (product_id).

By joining these two data streams together based on the "product_id" field, we can get a more complete picture of each product's sales and inventory history. For example, we could use this joined data to identify which products are selling quickly and need to be restocked, or to identify which products are generating the most revenue.

Overall, joining compatible streams of data can help you gain valuable insights and make more informed decisions based on a more complete picture of your data.
